# Aerovista-Runway-Dataset
Aerovista Runway Dataset is based on multiple sets of runway monocular data in different scenes and weather conditions. The data is obtained through real flight, simulation and other methods. The collection of runway image data is not easy, and we hope that the open source ATD data can help more researchers.
